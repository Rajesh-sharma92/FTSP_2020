Name: 
    Random Game 2         
Filename:
    randon_game2.py
Problem Statement:
    Write a program for a game where the computer generates a
    random starting number between 20 and 30.
    The player and the computer can remove 1,2 or 3 from the number
    in turns. Something like this...
    Starting number : 25
    How many do you want to remove? 3
    22 left
    Computer removes 2
    20 left
    The player who has to remove the last value to bring the number
    down to 0 is the loser.
    1 left
    Computer removes 1
    You win!
    Easy option
    Get the computer to choose a number between 1â€”3 at random
    Harder option
