Q1. What is the file Handling concept ?

Answer :- 

Read Mode :-
----------

file = open('E:\Online Forsk QA\Test.txt','r') # Default mode of file is always 'r' mode Means Read only.
# file = open('E:\Online Forsk QA\Test.txt') # Not given file mode means Default as 'r' mode only.

file.read()
# file.close() 

******* Output******
FORSK CODING SCHOOL 
FORSK TECHNOLOGIES
FORSK JAIPUR
Forsk people teaches the following subjects like DS,ML and DL.
"THANK YOU SO MUCH FORSK TEAM"'

file.readline() # 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'

file.readline() # '"THANK YOU SO MUCH FORSK TEAM"'

file.readlines()

['FORSK TECHNOLOGIES\\n\n',
 'FORSK JAIPUR\\n\n',
 'Forsk people teaches the following subjects like DS,ML and DL.\\n\n',
 '"THANK YOU SO MUCH FORSK TEAM"\\n\n',
 '\n']

Wriet Mode :- 
----------
file = open('E:\Online Forsk QA\Test.txt','w')
file.write("WOW WHAT A GREAT TEAM THAT 'S FORSK TEAM ")
# Successfully we have written the msg into Test.txt file.

Append Mode :- 
-----------
file = open('E:\Online Forsk QA\Test.txt','a')
file.write('Machine Learning & AI & DL')
# Successfully we have written the msg into Test.txt file with existing data.





Q2. What is the use of plt.show() in Data visulazations ?
Answer :- 

# Here first we need to import the matplotlib library.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [2,4,6,8,10]
y = [2,4,6,8,10]

plt.scatter(x,y,color='Red')
plt.plot(x,y,color='Blue')
plt.xlabel('Time(x)')
plt.ylabel('Price(y)')
plt.title('Time-Price Graph')

plt.show() # It is used for to display the graph on console after plotting it.



Q3. What is the use of Line Ploting into graph ?
Answer :- 

A line plot is a graph that shows frequency of data along a number line. 
It is best to use a line plot when comparing fewer than 25 numbers. 
It is a quick, simple way to organize data.

A line graph, also known as a line chart, is a type of chart used to visualize the value of something over time. 
For example, a finance department may plot the change in the amount of cash the company has on hand over time. 
The line graph consists of a horizontal x-axis and a vertical y-axis.

# Here first we need to import the matplotlib library.
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [2,4,6,8,10]
y = [2,4,6,8,10]

plt.scatter(x,y,color='Red')
plt.plot(x,y,color='Blue')
plt.xlabel('Time(x)')
plt.ylabel('Price(y)')
plt.title('Time-Price Graph')

plt.show() # It is used for to display the graph on console after plotting it.





Q4. What is the use of different types charts into Data Analysis ?
Answer :- 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [10,20,30,40]
labels = ['One','two','three','four']

plt.bar(labels,x,color='Blue')
plt.xlabel('Months-Details')
plt.ylabel('Price-Details')
plt.legend()

plt.show()


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sizes = [70,5,5,20]
labels = ['ML','DL','CS','DS']
colors = ['blue','red']
explode = (0,0,0,0)

plt.pie(sizes , explode = explode , labels = labels , colors = colors , autopct = '%1.2f%%' , shadow = True , startangle = 270)
plt.axis('equal')

plt.xlabel('Months-Details')
plt.ylabel('Price-Details')
plt.legend()

plt.show()




Q5. What is the use of numpy Library and where it is used in the real time ?
Answer :- 

NumPy is the most basic yet a powerful package for scientific computing and data manipulation in Python. 
It is an open source library available in Python. It helps as to do the mathematical and scientific operation 
and used extensively in data science. It allows us to work with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

NumPy is a package in Python used for Scientific Computing. NumPy package is used to perform different operations.
 The ndarray (NumPy Array) is a multidimensional array used to store values of same datatype. 
These arrays are indexed just like Sequences, starts with zero.

Ex :- 

import numpy as np

array = np.arange(10)

print(array) # [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]

new_matrix = array.reshape(2,5)
print(new_matrix)

[[0 1 2 3 4]
 [5 6 7 8 9]]

print(new_matrix.size) # 10 

print(new_matrix.ndim) # 2

print(new_matrix.dtype) # int32




Q6. How to use pandas unique count function ?
Answer :- 

import pandas as pd

dataset = pd.Series([10,20,30,10,30,40,50])

print(dataset)
****************
0    10
1    20
2    30
3    10
4    30
5    40
6    50
dtype: int64

dataset.values
****************
array([10, 20, 30, 10, 30, 40, 50], dtype=int64)

dataset.value_counts
*********************
1    20
2    30
3    10
4    30
5    40
6    50
dtype: int64

dataset.unique()
***********************
array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], dtype=int64)




Q7. How to create Histogram ?

Answer :- 

Draw a histogram of the salaries divided into bin starting 
   from 50K and increment of 15K.
   
   
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('E:\PYTHON CODE Challenges\Pandas\Salaries.csv')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.hist(df['salary'] , bins = range(50000 , 210000 , 15000) , color='Royalblue')

#plt.axis([45000,210000,0,20])
plt.xlabel('No. of Salaries')
plt.ylabel('No.of Employees')
plt.title('Salaries Details')

plt.savefig('E:\Forsk Pandas\Hist_sal.jpg')
plt.show()






Q8. Which male and female professor has the highest and lowest salary ?

Answer :- 

# 1. Which Male and Female Professor has the highest and the lowest salaries.

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('E:/PYTHON CODE Challenges/Pandas/Salaries.csv') # Reading a csv file into data frame.

df.info()

df_max_f = df[(df['sex']) & (df['rank']=='Prof')][['salary']].max()
df_min_f = df[(df['sex']=='Female') & (df['rank']=='Prof')][['salary']].min()
df_max_m = df[(df['sex']=='Male') & (df['rank']=='Prof')][['salary']].max()
df_min_m = df[(df['sex']=='Male') & (df['rank']=='Prof')][['salary']].min()
