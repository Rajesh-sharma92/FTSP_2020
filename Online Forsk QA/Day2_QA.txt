Q1. difference between a Data Analyst and a Data Scientist ?

Answer :-

Data Scientist :-  who can predict the future data based on previous (past) data and to get the better predictions  for 
                   latest projects as per industries requirement. Here We will be using the Machine Learning (ML) Concepts.
		   In the ML we use the differnt Algorithms to get the better predictions.


Data Analyst :-  Data analysts are the one who do the day-to-day analysis stuff.A data analyst will solve the questions 
		 given by the business. To analysis on data we use some important libraries like Pandas , Numpay and etc.




Q2. what is the use of None datatype in python ?
Answer :- 
          None datatype is a reserved keyword,which is an object that indicates no value.
          None is the return value of functions that "don't return anything".
          Ex :- x = 100 
		print(x)
		O/P = 100
		
		If x is no longer required then we will be assign x = None
		X = None
		print(x)
		
		O/P :- Here we will get the None in the result coz currently x value will be as None.





Q3. At a time just one statement is running ? What to do to run entire program ?
Answer :- 
	  It's all upon you,you can run only single statement or multiple statement by selecting those and press shift + enter.
          For run entire programme you have to press F5 function key. 
		
	Ex :-   s = 'Forsk coding school'
	  	print(s)



Q4. What is the difference b/w str[1] and str[0:1] ?
Anwser :- 
          str = 'Forsk coding school'

		 Syntax :- [Start : end -1 , step]
			
		'F o r s k c o d i n g  s  c  h  o  o  l'
		 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

	         print(str[1])    then output is "o" . It is called indexing. if there is space in between words then space should be counted as 1.


                 print(str[0:1])  then output is "o" .It is called slicing. you can print selected words.In slicing (end -1).

		 print(str[0:5])   then output is "Forsk".

		 print(str[1:5:2])  then output will be "os oi"



Q5. How to print string in reverse  order ?
Answer :- 
str = 'Forsk coding school'

str[-1: :-1] --> 'loohcs gnidoc ksroF'

str[: :-1] --> 'loohcs gnidoc ksroF'



Q6. How to avoid space b/w in strings ?

Answer :- 
	str = 'Forsk coding school'
	
	s1 = str.replace(" ","")
	
	print(s1) # 'Forskcodingschool'



syntax :- string_name.replace(old, new)



Q7. Can we use slicing concept in backward indexing ?
Answer :- Yes. we can do it. 

	str = 'Forsk coding school'

	str[-1: :-1] --> 'loohcs gnidoc ksroF'




Q8. Can we use stepping in reverse index as well ?
Answer :- Yes. we can do it. 

	str1 = 'Forsk coding school'

	str1[: : -2] --> 'loc ndckrF'




Q9. How to define string size in python ?
Answer :- Here we can define size of any string in python by using len() function.

 Ex :- 	str1 = 'Forsk coding school'
	
	print(len(str1)) ---> 19 , NOTE :- here length function includes the total size of string and It length always starts from 1. and Indexing starts from zero(0).




Q10. Can we print whole string by using of reverse indexing ?
Answer :- Yes, We can perform this by using slicing concept in python.
	Ex :- 
	str1 = 'Forsk coding school'
	
	str1[ : : -1]



Q11. Can we replace any character in strings ?	
Answer :- Yes, We can do it by using the replace() function.
Ex :- 
 	str1 = 'Forsk coding school'
	
	str1.replace('c','C') ---> 'Forsk Coding sChool'
	
	str1.replace('o','O') ---> 'FOrsk cOding schOOl'



Q12. Can we print the –ve indexing in string ?
Answer :- Yes, We can do it by slicing concept in python.

Ex :- str1 = 'Forsk coding school'

str1[-5] ---> 'c'

str1[:-10] ---> 'Forsk cod'




Q13. Can we write str1='f' in python ?
Answer :- Yes, We can do it and pls see the below example.

	str1 = 'f'
	print(str1) ---> f

	str2 = "f"
	print(str2) ---> f

	str3 = '''f'''
	print(str3) ---> f



Q14. Can we pass argument in split function ?
Answer :- Yes, We can pass any argument into split function and after spliting it will be inside the list.

Ex :- 

str1 = 'Forsk coding school'

s2 = str1.split(' ') # Here we are passing the space as an argument.

print(str1) # Forsk coding school

print(s2) # ['Forsk', 'coding', 'school']




Q15. Can we concatenated two strings OR can we merge 2 strings ?
Answer :- Yes, We can merge 2 strings by doing concatenation like plus operator (+).

str1 = 'Forsk coding school'
str2 = ' at Jaipur, India'
str3 = str1+str2
print(str3) # Forsk coding school at Jaipur, India





Q16.  How the string is immutable ?

s1 = 'Forsk'
s2 = s1.upper()

print(s2) #  'FORSK'

print(s1) # 'Forsk'

NOTE :- Here s2 string will be just changed on console but it will not be changed 
in the actual string like s1. s1 always remains the same. That's why we can called 
strings are Immutable.

Strings are Immutable Means :- It means we can some operation on strings but it will
---------------------------  not be affected in actual strings.

Ex :-

str1 = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'
s2 = str1.lower()

print(s2) # 'forsk coding school'

print(str1) # 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'



Q17. How to remove white space in string ?

str1 = 'Forsk coding school'
s2 = str1.replace(' ','')
print(s2)

s1 = 'JAIPUR IS IN RAJASTHAN , INDIA'
s2 = s1.replace(' ','**')
print(s2)

NOTE :- In the above 2 examples we can see that we can replace the white space with any special characters or space also.




Q18. Can we pass an argument in the upper function  ?

def Big_Letter(text):  
    return text.upper()  
    
print(Big_Letter('hello'))  
    
Result = Big_Letter
    
print(Result('hello'))

NOTE :- Yes, We can but not directly inside the upper() function. We just need to create a function then we need to use it.




Q19. Can we use keyword as identifier in python ?
Answer : - No we can not coz Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name, function name or any other identifier. 
They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.All the keywords except True , False and None are in 
lowercase and they must be written as it is.

A Python identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object. 
An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores and digits (0 to 9).

Ex :- 

a = 10
print(a) # 10

_x = 200
print(_x) # 200

x123 = 25
print(x123) # 25

z_90 = 100
print(z_90) # 100

# 8A = 45
8_A = 45
print(8A) # It is not valid coz , Variables or identifiers should not starts with numbers. like 0 - 9.




Q20. What is the difference between strip() and replace()?
Answer :-

strip() :-

s1 = '    Forsk Technologies  '
s2 = s1.strip()

print(s1) # '    Forsk Technologies  '

print(s2) # Forsk Technologies

replace() :-

s1 = 'Forsk Technologies'
s2 = s1.replace('Technologies','Coding School')

print(s1) # Forsk Technologies

print(s2) # Forsk Coding School




Q21. If we have a str1 = "Forsk Jaipur"
		print(str1[3:11])     
output "sk Jaipu" I don't want space.So, Is this possible ?

Answer :- Yes, We can remove those spaces from that string.

str1 = "Forsk Jaipur"

s1 = str1[3:11]  
s2 = s1.split()

s3 = ''.join(s2)  

print(s3) # 'skJaipu'



Q22. Why internally strings will not changed after performing some operations ?

Answer :- We know that Strings are Immutable and we can perform some operations on strings but it will not
changed at the actual strings. Internally strings are always will be the same as actual before perfroming any operations.

Ex :-

s1 = 'Forsk'
s2 = s1.upper()

print(s2) #  'FORSK'

print(s1) # 'Forsk'

NOTE :- Here s2 string will be just changed on console but it will not be changed 
in the actual string like s1. s1 always remains the same. That's why we can called 
strings are Immutable.

Strings are Immutable Means :- It means we can some operation on strings but it will
---------------------------  not be affected in actual strings.

Ex :-

str1 = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'
s2 = str1.lower()

print(s2) # 'forsk coding school'

print(str1) # 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'




Q23. What are local variables and global variables in Python?
Answer :-

local variables:- 

def m1(): # Method defining.
    
    x = 100 # Local variable
    print(x) # 100
    
m1() # Method calling

global variables :- 

class Test:
    x = 100 # This is global variable inside the class. It is like Class level variable also.
    
    def m1(self):
        print('This is m1() method')
        
t = Test() # Object creation

t.m1() # This is m1() method


print('X value :', t.x) # X value : 100





Q24. Strings are immutable then how it is replacable ,how it is work internally ?
Answer :- We know that Strings are Immutable and we can perform some operations on strings but it will not
changed at the actual strings. Internally strings are always will be the same as actual before perfroming any operations.

Ex :-

s1 = 'Forsk'
s2 = s1.upper()

print(s2) #  'FORSK'

print(s1) # 'Forsk'

NOTE :- Here s2 string will be just changed on console but it will not be changed 
in the actual string like s1. s1 always remains the same. That's why we can called 
strings are Immutable.

Strings are Immutable Means :- It means we can some operation on strings but it will
---------------------------  not be affected in actual strings.

Ex :-

str1 = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'
s2 = str1.lower()

print(s2) # 'forsk coding school'

print(str1) # 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'




Q25. str1 = "INDIA"
	str2 = "IS"
	str3 = "BEST"
print (str1,str2,str3)

How we can make strings in a whole new string ?

Answer :- 

str1 = "INDIA"
str2 = "IS"
str3 = "BEST"

print (str1,str2,str3)

str4 = str1+str2+str3
print(str4)




Q26. How is it useful srtip() in python  ?


s1 = '   INDIA IS BEST  ' # Space available in the first & last location .

s2 = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL    ' # Space available in the last location.

s3 = s1+s2
s4 = s3.strip()

print(s4) # INDIA IS BEST  FORSK CODING SCHOOL




Q27. To learn python which book we can prefer ?

Answer :-  Here you can refer this website for Python.

For Python :-

Q28. Can we prefer w3 schools website for Python ?

Answer :- Yes, You can refer w3schools website for Python and It contains more Interesting topics & Logics.




Q29. What is the best platform to master numpy and pandas ?
Answer :-

Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the most widely used python libraries in data science. It provides high-performance, easy to use structures and data analysis tools.
Unlike NumPy library which provides objects for multi-dimensional arrays, Pandas provides in-memory 2d table object called Dataframe
