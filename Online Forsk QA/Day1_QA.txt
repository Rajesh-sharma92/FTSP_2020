Q1. Can we use python for complex web application projects where lots of data and transections happens ?
Answer :- 

Python can be used to build server-side web applications. However, most Python developers write their web applications using a combination of Python and JavaScript. 
Python is executed on the server side while JavaScript is downloaded to the client and run by the web browser.
Web development using Python has been very popular for years – and for all the right reasons. 
Not only is it a perfect language for beginners but it can also serve you as stepping stone for learning more complicated languages.
Python is better in the long-term projects. PHP has a very low learning curve, and it is straightforward to get started with. 
Python uses indentation enforcements that are quite strict. This makes it more readable than PHP.




Q2. Can you please tell me the use of bool and complex Datatypes ?
Answer :- 

Here in the bool datatypes we will using the boolean values like
True, False.

Ex:-

x =a 100
y = 200

if x == y:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

***** Result *****
False

x = 400
y = 500

if x < y:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)

***** Result *****
 True
  
NOTE :- In the complex data Types will be like.

c = (ai+j)

z = (xi+j)





Q3. Why data types are having same size as we can see in variable explorer?
Answer :- 

Because it is due to store in a variable. 
when we store a string or int variable in x then we can see that here we are 
storing any variable in other variable so size always will be same.

eg
x = 5         #size will be 1
x = "Rajesh"  #size will be 1

Note:- here we are storing only one variable in x. 
       so size will be same.
       
NOTE :- If we are storing the some values in the list then size will be different like.
Ex :- list1 = [10,20,30,40] # Size will be 4.




Q4. What will the size of float will be same as double as  far as precision is concerned ? 
Answer :- In python we do not have double data type concept and we will be using 
only float values. 
Ex :- 

a = 100.330 # size will be 1

x = 20.5 # size will be 1



Q5. How to take multiple input in a single statement / single line ?
Answer :-

x,y = input('Enter the values x :'),input('Enter the values y :')
        
       or
       
x = input("Enter the values: ").split()



Q6. What is the use of main in python ?
Answer :-

The main function in Python acts as the point of execution for any program. Defining the main 
function in Python programming is a necessity to start the execution of the program as it gets 
executed only when the program is run directly and not executed when imported as a module.

And the biggest advantage with the language is that it is quite easy to learn.



Q14. What is vector in python ?
Answer :- 
We can represent a vector in Python as a NumPy array. A NumPy array can be created from a list of numbers. 
For example, below we define a vector with the length of 3 and the integer values 1, 2 and 3.

from numpy import array 

v1 = array([1, 2, 3]) 
v2 = array([2.5,3.5,5.5])
v3 = v2+v1

print(v3) # [3.5 5.5 8.5]

v3 = v2-v1

print(v3) # [1.5 1.5 2.5]


Q15. Can we directly type cast a variable like 
	age=int(input("enter your age")) ?

Answer :- Yes, Offcourse, we can directly type cast any variables in python as per our requirements.
please check in the below examples.

age=int(input("enter your age :")) # Indirectly - Type casting.
if age > 60:
    print('Senior Citizens') # Senior Citizens


age = input('Enter your age :')

age = int(age) # Directly - Type casting.

if age < 21:
    print('Teeneger Person') # Teeneger Person

Q25. Do we have char datatypes in python ?
Answer :- No, we don't have any char data types in python.We have string data types in python.

Python does not have a character or char type. All single characters are strings with length one.

Ex :- 

s = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'
print(type(s))
print(s)

***** Output *********
<class 'str'>
FORSK CODING SCHOOL


s1 = ''Forsk Technologies at Jaipur''
print(type(s1))
print(s1)

***** Output *********
<class 'str'>
Forsk Technologies at Jaipur


s2 = 'F'
print(type(s2))
print(s2)
***** Output *********
<class 'str'>
F


Q26. What will happens, If we define a string a without any quote ?
Answer :- Here we will be getting an error if we don't defined any single/double/triple Quotes for strings.

Ex :- 

str1 = FORSK SCHOOL # Defined as string as without any quotes and it will through an error like 

# str1 = FORSK SCHOOL
                      ^
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

NOTE :- Strings always in python we need to define inside of the Quotes like single/double/triple Quotes.



Q27. Do we have the concept of "Type Casting” in Python ?
Answer :- 

Implicit Type Conversion is automatically performed by the Python interpreter. 
Python avoids the loss of data in Implicit Type Conversion. 
Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting.
The data types of object are converted using predefined function by user.

Casting is when you convert a variable value from one type to another. This is, in Python, 
done with functions such as int() or float() or str().

Ex :- 

x = 10 
print(type(x)) # <class 'int'>
print(x) # 10

x = float(x)
print(type(x)) # <class 'float'>
print(x) # 10.0

x = str(x) # '10.0'
print(type(x)) # <class 'str'>
print(x) # 10.0


 

Q28. Which is the best IDE’s as per specific tasks to perform in python , ML and DL etc ?

Machine Learning , Deep Learning and etc.

NOTE :- Spyder is the best for Data Visulazations , Data Analytics and etc.




Q29. Can we convert string into integer if the string have digits ?
Answer :- Here we can't convert strings into Integers wheather strings contains digits or not.
If we try to convert into Integer than we will be getting any error like ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Forsk'.

str1 = 'forsk12345' # String with digits.
print(type(str1))
print(str1)

str2 = int(str1) # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'Forsk12345'


str1 = 'FORSK' # String without digits
print(type(str1))
print(str1)

str2 = int(str1) # ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'FORSK'.




Q30. IF I NEED  SQRT OF A VECTOR eg (4,25,225,16) IN A SINGLE STATEMENT THEN ?
Answer :- As we can see that sqrt can gives the square root for the single values only in single line.

But If we need sqrt of multiple values then we should this kind of below concept and It will be working perfectly.

Ex1 :- 


from math import sqrt

s1 = sqrt(36)
print(s1) # 6.0


s1 = sqrt([4,16,25,36]) # Sqrt with multiple values in the single line. # TypeError: must be real number, not list.

Ex2 :- 

from math import sqrt
array = [4,25,225,16]
print(array)

list2 = []

for ele in array:
    sq = sqrt(ele)
    list2.append(sq)
print(list2)
    
******** Output *******
[2.0, 5.0, 15.0, 4.0]
