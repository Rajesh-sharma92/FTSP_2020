Q1. What is the difference b/w if and elif ?
Answer :- 
            note:- if and elif both are take condition.
               
            but elif always write after if condition if we want to take more condition in our program. then we use elif condition.
            for further we can understand by example

            #program giving grade according to marks.

            marks = int(input("Enter marks: "))

            if marks > 60:
                print("Grade A")
            elif marks >= 45 and marks <= 60: 
                print("Grade B")
            else:
                print("Fail")

            output:
            Enter marks: 55
            Grade B



Q2. Is it compulsory to use else in the end ?
Answer :- 
          No, It is not compulsory to use in python. because python is a scripting language.
          
          Ex :- 

          list = ["Ram","Mohan","Seeta","Ramesh"]

          for name in list:
               if name[0] == "R":  #here we are using only if condition not need to use else.
                     print(name)
  
          output:-
          Ram
          Ramesh



Q3. Can we write number++ instead of number=number+1 in python ?
Answer :- 
	  No, we do not use "number++" here, for increment of number. 
          we can only two types use for increment of number
          1) number += 1
          2) number = number + 1
          
          Ex:-
          number = 0
          while (number<10):
                 print(number)
                 number +=1     
                # number = number + 1

          output:-
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


Q4. Can we use for increment number++ ?
Answer :- 
	  No, we do not use "number++" here, for increment of number. 
          we can only two types use for increment of number
          1) number += 1
          2) number = number + 1
          
          Ex:-
          number = 0
          while (number<10):
                 print(number)
                 number +=1     
                # number = number + 1

          output:-
          0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 


Q5. Can we use exit() function instead of break ?
Answer :- No, We can not use exit() Function instead of break.
          if we use exit() function then our console will Restart and it will not any result.
          
          Ex 1:-
         list = ["Ram","Mohan","Seeta","Ramesh"]

         for name in list:
              if name[0] == "S":
                   break
              print(name)
         
         output:-
         Ram
         Mohan
 
        Ex 2:-
         list = ["Ram","Mohan","Seeta","Ramesh"]

         for name in list:
              if name[0] == "S":
                   exit()
              print(name)
         
         output:-
             
                   Kernel Will Restart


Q6.If We are using exit() kernal is closed and new kernal is started ?
Answer :- If we are using exit() function in the program then Kernal will be closed and Re-starting.

Ex :-
         list = ["Ram","Mohan","Seeta","Ramesh"]

         for name in list:
              if name[0] == "S":
                   exit()
              print(name)
         
         output :- Kernel Will Restart
             
                   



Q7. How will you print the names starts only with R ?
Answer :- 
Ex :- 

          list = ["Ram","Mohan","Seeta","Ramesh"]

          for name in list:
               if name[0] == "R":  #here we are using only if condition not need to use else.
                     print(name)
  
          output:-
          Ram
          Ramesh

Q8. Suppose if there is a list having no.=5 two times and 
we want to print the data next from 2nd 5th, then what should be the program ?
Answer :- 
 
	list = [2,5,9,8,5,4,6,2,7]
	a = []

	for index,i in enumerate(list):
    		if list[index] == 5:
        	a.append(index)

	b = a[1]
	for i in list[b:]:
    	print(i)

	Result : - 5
		   4
		   6
		   2
		   7

Q9. If we want to break the infinite loop at run time in pycharm than what we have to press ?
Answer :- 

PyCharm implements the terminal functionality with a bundled plugin.
which can be completely disabled by clearing the Terminal checkbox on the the Plugins page of PyCharm settings Ctrl+Alt+S . 
Specify the working directory where the terminal will be launched.

NOTE :- We can stop the current execution by pressing some from keyboard like CTRL+C.



Q10. Here list only support same data type like arrays ?
Answer :-

	list1 = ['Forsk','school',10,20,30.5,50.89,-23,0,1,-9]
	print(list1)

	list1[0] # 'Forsk'

	list1[-1] # -9

	list1[:5] # ['Forsk', 'school', 10, 20, 30.5]

	list1[1:-1]  # ['school', 10, 20, 30.5, 50.89, -23, 0, 1]




Q11. As we applied the RANGE function on Integers, Can we apply the RANGE function on STRING ?
Answer :- 

range() function only works with the integers i.e. whole numbers.User can not pass a string or float number or any other type in a start, 
stop and step argument of a range(). All three arguments can be positive or negative. The step value must not be zero


for i in range(10):
    print(i , end=' ')
    

str1 = 'Forsk coding school'

for ch in str1:
    
    print(ch , end=' ')
    


Q12. What is random function ?

Answer :- 
	It is used to generate the random numbers like Integers 1,6,9,0,100.
	First of all we need to import the Random numbers than we should it.
	Python offers random module that can generate random numbers. 
	These are pseudo-random number as the sequence of number generated depends on the seed.
	If the seeding value is same, the sequence will be the same. For example, 
	if you use 2 as the seeding value, you will always see the following sequence.

	from random import random

	random() # 0.568624355739006

	random() # 0.7953050641620346

	random() # 0.4211208306247237




Q13. WAP to print a name from a list using for loop how to do it ?
Answer :- 

Ex :- 1

list1 = ['FORSK','CODING','SCHOOL','JAIPUR']

for name in list1:
    print(name , end=' ') # FORSK CODING SCHOOL JAIPUR 
    
Ex :- 2

list2 = ['Rajesh','sharma','sandeep','Mohit','Ravi']  

for name in list2:
    print(name , end=' ') # Rajesh sharma sandeep Mohit Ravi 

 



Q15. If we run any infinite loop than how we can come out from that loop?
Answer :- Infinite loops means while(True) or while(1).

	while(True):
   	   x = input('enter the value of n :')
    		if not x:
        	    break
    		print(x)
    
 Result : -

enter the value of n :10
10

enter the value of n :20
20

enter the value of n :30
30

enter the value of n :




Q16. Why the names get printed in the new line every time ?
Answer :- 

list1 = ['Forsk','Technologies','Jaipur','India']
for name in list1:
    print(name) 
    
    Result :- 
    Forsk
    Technologies
    Jaipur
    India
    

for name in list1:
    print(name,end=' ')

Result :-  Forsk Technologies Jaipur India 





Q17. Is it important  to use list for execution of for loop ?
Answer :- In Python there so many concepts available like for you can use with lists,tuples,set and dictionaries.


list1 = ['Forsk','Technologies','Jaipur','India']
for name in list1:
    print(name) 
    
    Result :- 
    Forsk
    Technologies
    Jaipur
    India
    

str1 = 'FORSK CODING SCHOOL'
for ch in str1:
    print(ch, end=' ')





Q18. Pls explain this below example ?

values = range(10,20)

for number in values:
        if(number==15):
               continue #  If the condition is True then it will not be consider the
                        # Then it will Ignore that condition value and prints further.
        print(number)



values = range(10,20)

for number in values:
        if(number==15):
               break # It will break the loops there only.
        print(number)
